# config

Add configurations for modules into this folder.

e.g. a module called hello-world will have its configs at $TUSH_PATH/data/config/hello-world/

Each module should have its own configuration folder.
Each module should have a unique name for that folder.
Modules mustn't interfere with other module data folders.
